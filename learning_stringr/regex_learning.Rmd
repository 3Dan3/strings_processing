The various types of operators, based on their main use can be grouped into to four basic operations for creating regular expressions

* Concatenation
* Logical OR
* Replication
* Grouping

These operations can be considered the building blocks of regular expressions operators. By combining them in several ways, we can represent very complicated and sophisticated patterns.

## metacharacters

![](PNGs/meta_char_tbl.PNG)

Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. For example, "1" matches 1 and "blue" matches blue. However, there are some special characters that have a reserved status and they are known as _metacharacters_

As we can see from the table in R we have to escape special characters with double backlash `\\`. For example, if we want to remove th dollar sign from the string named `money`

```{r}
# string
money <- "$money"

# remove $ sign
money %>%
  str_remove("\\$")
```

We can see some other toy examples

```{r}
# plus
"Peace+Love" %>%
  str_remove("\\+")

# caret
"Peace^Love" %>%
  str_remove("\\^")

# vertical bar
"Peace|Love" %>%
  str_remove("\\|")

# opening round bracket
"Peace(Love)" %>%
  str_remove("\\(")

# closing round bracket
"Peace(Love)" %>%
  str_remove("\\)")

# double backslash
"Peace\\Love" %>%
  str_remove("\\\\")
```

## sequences

![](PNGs/anchor_tbl.PNG)

Sequences define, no surprinsingly, sequences of characters which can match. We have short-hand versions (or anchors) for commonly used sequences in R:

Let's see some examples

```{r}

# define string
string <- "the dandelion war 2010"



# replace first digit with '_'
string %>%
  str_replace("\\d", "_")

# replace all
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\d", "_")

# replace non-digit with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\D", "_")

# replace spaces with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")

# replace non-space with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\S", "_")

# replace word with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\w", "_")

# replace non-word with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\W", "_")

# replace word boundary with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\b", "_")

# replace non-word boundary with _
string %>%
  str_replace_all("\\B", "_")


```

## character classes

![](PNGs/character_set_tbl.PNG)

A character class or character set is a list of characters enclosed by square brackets [ ].

Character sets are used to match only one of several characters. For instance, the regex character class `[aA]` matches any lower case letter a or any upper case letter A. Likewise, the
regular expression `[0123456789]` matches any single digit.

A particular case of character classes is when we include the caret ^ at the beginning of the list: this indicates that the regular expression matches any character NOT in the list.

Let's see a basic example. Imagine that we have a character vector with several words and that we are interested in matching those words containing the vowels `e` or `i`. For this purpose, we can use the character class `[ei]`:

```{r}
# some string
transport <- c("car", "bike", "plane", "boat")

# matching words
transport %>%
  str_subset("[ei]")

# some numeric strings
numerics <- c("123", "17-April", "I-II-III", "R 3.0.1")

# match strings containing 0 or 1
numerics %>%
  str_subset("[01]")

# match any digit
numerics %>% 
  str_subset("[0-9]")

# match negated digit
numerics %>%
  str_subset("[^0-9]")
```

## POSIX character classes

![](PNGs/POSIX_clas_tbl.PNG)

Closely related to the regex character classes we have what is known as POSIX character classes. In R, POSIX character classes are represented with expressions inside double brackets `[[ ]]`.

We can see some examples:

```{r}
# la vie (string)
la_vie <- "La vie en #FFCOCB (rose); \nCes't la vie! \t tres jolie"

# remove space characters
la_vie %>%
  str_replace_all("[[:blank:]]", "")

# remove digits
la_vie %>%
  str_replace_all("[[:xdigit:]]", "")

# remove printable characters
la_vie %>%
  str_replace_all("[[:print:]]", "")

# remove graphical characters
la_vie %>%
  str_replace_all("[[:graph:]]", "")

# remove non-graphical characters
la_vie %>%
  str_replace_all("[^[:graph:]]", "")
  
```

##  quantifiers

![](PNGs/quantifiers_tbl.PNG)

These are used when we want to match a certain number of characters that meet certain criteria.
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found

Some examples

```{r}
# people names
people <- c("rori", "emilia", "matteo", "mehmet", "filipe", "anna", "tyler",
            "rasmus", "jacob", "youna", "flora", "adi")

# match 'm' at most once
people %>%
  str_subset("m?")

# match 'm' exactly once
people %>%
  str_subset("m{1}")

# match 'm' zero or more times, and 't'
people %>%
  str_subset("m*t")

# match 't' zero or more times, and 'm'
people %>%
  str_subset("t*m")

# match 'm' one or more times
people %>%
  str_subset("m+")

# match 'm' one or more times, and 't'
people %>%
  str_subset("m+.t")

# match 't' exactly twice
people %>%
  str_subset("t{2}")

```
